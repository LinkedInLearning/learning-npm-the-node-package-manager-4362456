This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Learning npm: A Package Manager. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

![Learning npm: A Package Manager][lil-thumbnail-url] 

npm is an indispensable part of every developer's toolbox. It's the package manager for JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js, enabling developers to easily share and re-use code. In this course, Emmanuel Henri teaches developers how to work with npm commands to install and manage project dependencies. He starts with showing how to install npm, and details all the basic tools you can use with npm, such as adding, updating, or removing a package. Emmanuel then shows you how to take your skills to the next level, taking a dive deep into advanced features like npm cache, audits, scripting, and more.


_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
